<!-- Hackathons --> 

  ## üê±‚Äçüíª Hackathons
  
  ### ‚úçÔ∏è [JapanGo](https://github.com/bxian03/StormHacks2023)
  JapanGo is a multiplayer, web-based game designed to help people become familiar with the Japanese alphabets in a fun and competitive way. Inspired by skribbl.io, users are able to create a room, share the code and then race to see who can decipher the question first. It was created during Stormhacks 2023, an in-person 24 hour hackathon. Using websockets and Firebase, we were able to create a real-time connection between different clients with minimal latency, removing technical issues so that users could focus on memorizing their alphabets. Other technologies that we used include React and Tailwind for the frontend, and Python with FastAPI in the backend.
  
  ### üß™ [Organic Chemistry Quiz Discord Bot](https://github.com/im-calvin/HackToSchoolBot22) [(Hack To School 2022 Hackathon First Overall)](https://github.com/bxian03/HackToSchoolAPI22)
  The Organic Chemistry Quiz Discord Bot was aimed to make learning compound names more fun and engaging. We created a Discord bot that quizzes users on compound names and awards points for correct answers. It was created in Hack To School 2022 a 48 hour MLH Hackathon, we used discord.py for the bot, Express.JS for the API and MongoDB for the database. Participating in my first hackathon was an amazing learning experience where I honed my skills in pair programming, time-management, and effective communication
